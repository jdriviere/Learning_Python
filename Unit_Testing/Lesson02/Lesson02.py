LESSON 2 - Unit Tests Using UNITTEST Libraries

-- 1-1 UNITTEST --
"unittest came to life as a third-party module PyUnit. PyUnit was the Python port
for JUnit. JUnit is Java's xUnit-style unit test automation framework.

The PyUnit became part of the Python Standard library from version 2.5 onward.
It was rechristened unittest. Unittest is the batteries-included test automation library
of Python, which means you do not have to install an additional library or tool in order
to start using it." (p.31)

See the following files to know how to implement the Unittest:
- test_module01.py (Unittest)
- test_module02.py (Unittest order)
- test_module03.py (Unittest order and error output)
- test_module04.py (Unittest multiple TestClass)
- test_module05.py (Test Fixtures)
- test_module06.py (Running without unittest.main())
